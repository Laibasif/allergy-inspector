Create a visual sequence for the list of allergies {0} by highlighting affected areas on a silhouette. 
For each allergy, start with the allergy name followed by a colon, and list each scene in square brackets to show movement for 5-second video clips.
Each symptom description should be vivid, clear, and include medical and preventive elements, ensuring that the symptom is fully and effectively portrayed in a way that informs and educates viewers about prevention without unnecessary or distressing details.
