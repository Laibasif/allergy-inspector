Create a visual sequence for the list of allergies {0} by highlighting affected areas on a silhouette. 
For each allergy, start with the allergy name followed by a colon, and list each scene in square brackets to show movement for 5-second video clips.
Each symptom description should be vivid, clear, and include medical and preventive elements, ensuring that the symptom is fully and effectively portrayed in a way that informs and educates viewers about prevention without unnecessary or distressing details.

Format:
	(Allergy Name: [person silhouette highlight affected area with color and description of symptom][additional symptom scenes to illustrate progression and preventive notes.])

Example for dust mite allergy:
	(Dust Mite Allergy: [person silhouette highlight nose, eyes, and chest in red for respiratory irritation and itchy eyes],[Dust mite allergies can lead to sneezing, nasal congestion, itchy, watery eyes, and coughing],[highlight chest and lungs if severe, with preventive advice on regular bedding washing, using allergen-proof covers, and maintaining a clean environment.])
