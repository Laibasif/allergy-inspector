Compare the ingredients with the userâ€™s allergy profile. For each ingredient, return an assessment in this format and order them from most dangerous to safest:
[safety status, ingredient emoji, ingredient name, description]

The safety status should be:
- "dangerous" if the ingredient contains the allergen.
- "alert" if there's a mild risk or possible cross-contamination.
- "safe" if there is no allergy risk.

Avoid lengthy explanations and include only essential details about the safety status.

The emoji should represent the ingredient itself (e.g. ðŸ¥› for milk or ðŸŒ° for nuts)
